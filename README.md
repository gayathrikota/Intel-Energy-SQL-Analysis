# Intel Energy SQL Analysis

This repository features SQL-based data analysis performed using SQLPad, focusing on U.S. energy generation trends. The analysis leverages Intel’s power plant and energy production datasets to uncover insights on fuel types, plant distribution, and energy output.

## Project Objectives

- Join and analyze energy datasets to explore plant-level generation patterns
- Identify total energy production by fuel type and state
- Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable sources
- Optimize SQL queries for clarity, accuracy, and performance

## Tools & Technologies

- SQLPad – for writing, executing, and testing SQL queries
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL style) – for querying datasets
- Git & GitHub – for version control and documentation

## Files Included

- `Intel_SQL_Solution_Gayathri_Kota_Professional.pdf`  
  Final version with clean SQL queries and complete analysis

## Key Learnings

- Efficient data joining and filtering using JOIN and WHERE clauses
- Aggregating energy production by region and fuel type
- Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular, readable queries
- Presenting SQL-based insights in a professional format
